## Hi there 👋

In Oct 2024 I decided I wanted to begin to develop and share my "mini-tools" or data analysis projects publicly, so here I am.

I do not have a computer science or engineering background, and I do love (deep) tech, making sense of the world, learning new and unfamiliar things, and growing my skills so that I can increase the leverage of my efforts. And of course, AI and all its fascinating, chaotic consequences: technological, socioeconomic, legal, philosophical, work-related, and on entrepreneurship/startups.

Mixing all of this up, we get my current purpose of sharing what I work on in github:
- publishing mini-tools that I create for myself. If they are useful to others too, then I am glad. 
- practicing data analysis (and what it takes) to derive some insights of whatever phenomena, as long as I find it interesting and worth my while.
- constantly improving as an analyst, domain expert, professional, and "product-person".
- possibly connect with others who share some of the things I mentioned 😁

This brings me to my current approach:
- I do not care about showcasing the most efficient code or the most elegant SQL/Python scripts or reports for data analyses. I am not using these repos as a "fine arts gallery"; rather, this is to be meant as a workshop: messy, work in progress, not so polished, real.
- I use a lot of AI assistance to get stuff done, iterate quickly, and get what I want, be it a function, a complicated SQL query, a solution to a technical problem. I care about getting to the outcomes I want as effeciently (and safely) as possible. So far, this approach has enabled me to learn a lot, quickly, mostly by doing.

Other facts about me:
- I am an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) nerd.
- I work in an AI startup operating in the pharmaceutical industry > drug discovery.
- I love learning new stuff and deepening stuff I already know. Bonus: I love when passionate people explain stuff to me and let me bombard them with questions.
- I hate football / soccer, and I am not so fond of sport-related talks.
- I can easily get absorbed by wildly different topics if there is a reason to, which can be as simple as someone mentioned this topic to me and sounded "nominally interesting".
- I am young and I am "desperate" to maximize my personal growth.

Currently (May 2025) working on:
- dataset building and analysis of siRNA therapeutics's clinical landscape, analyzing phase progression rates, prevalent therapeutic areas and conditions, drug delivery systems, targeted tissues, and any combination of the previous. It's cool because it is becoming an increasingly accurate (and rare) representation of the siRNA Tx market, observing it from (almost!) all of the relevant angles it can be looked at to act strategically. Helping with fundraising, credibility building, strategy formulation.
