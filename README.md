## Hi there 👋

In Oct 2024 I decided I wanted to begin to develop and share my "mini-tools" or data analysis projects publicly, so here I am.

I do not have a computer science or engineering background, and I do love (deep) tech, making sense of the world, learning new and unfamiliar things, and growing my skills so that I can increase the leverage of my efforts. And of course, AI and all its fascinating, chaotic consequences: technological, socioeconomic, legal, philosophical, work-related, and on entrepreneurship/startups.

Mixing all of this up, we get my current purpose of sharing what I work on in github:
- publishing mini-tools that I create for myself. If they are useful to others too, then I am glad. 
- practicing data analysis (and what it takes) to derive some insights of whatever phenomena, as long as I find it interesting and worth my while.
- constantly improving as an analyst, domain expert, professional, and "product-person".
- possibly connect with others who share some of the things I mentioned 😁

This brings me to my current approach:
- I do not care about showcasing the most efficient code or the most elegant SQL/Python scripts or reports for data analyses. I am not using these repos as a "fine arts gallery"; rather, this is to be meant as a workshop: messy, work in progress, not so polished, real.
- I use a lot of AI assistance to get stuff done, iterate quickly, and get what I want, be it a function, a complicated SQL query, a solution to a technical problem. I care about getting to the outcomes I want as effeciently (and safely) as possible. So far, this approach has enabled me to learn a lot, quickly, mostly by doing.

Other facts about me:
- I am an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) nerd.
- I work in an AI startup operating in the pharmaceutical industry > drug discovery.
- I love learning new stuff and deepening stuff I already know. Bonus: I love when passionate people explain stuff to me and let me bombard them with questions.
- I hate football / soccer, and I am not so fond of sport-related talks.
- I can easily get absorbed by wildly different topics if there is a reason to, which can be as simple as someone mentioned this topic to me and sounded "nominally interesting".
- I am young and I am "desperate" to maximize my personal growth.
